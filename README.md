# Week_2_VBA_Homework (VBA of Wall Street)

## Overview of Project
The second module challenge was to refactor VBA code in stock database to gather stock information in years 2017 & 2018 and determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing. Refractoring the original code should increase the efficiency.

We're looking at the years 2017 and 2018 stock returns for certain ticker symbols. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Wrapping my head around loops and multi-worksheets was a challenge.

Encountered some runtime errors, but fixed them by going through step by step to find where the hang-ups were.

Refractored code efficiency results
=======
We're looking at the years 2017 and 2018 stock returns for certain ticker symbols. 
- 2017 stocks listed all saw positive returns, with the outlier being TERP. 
- 2018 stock returns show negative returns with the exception of ENPH and RUN stocks.

Refactored code runs much faster then the original code. The results of refactoring code is the exactly
same a the original code output.

## Summary
2017 stocks listed all saw positive returns, with the outlier being TERP. 
2018 stock returns show negative returns with the exception of ENPH and RUN stocks.

=======
The refactored code runs much faster then the original code.

## Summary 
### Pros & Cons
Advantages of refactoring the original code are a much cleaner and efficient code as well as a reduced run-time. A user with little to no experience can use the code and get the same results. Using the refactored code allows use of much larger datasets then the original code. 
Using the refactored code could be a small con when using smaller datasets that may not need such complex coding.
