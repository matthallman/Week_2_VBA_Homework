# Week_2_VBA_Homework (VBA of Wall Street)

## Overview of Project
The second module challenge was to refactor VBA code in stock database to gather stock information in years 2017 & 2018 and determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing. Refractoring the original code should increase the efficiency.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Wrapping my head around loops and multi-worksheets was a challenge.
Encountered some runtime errors, but fixed them by going through step by step to find where the hang-ups were.

## Results

We're looking at the years 2017 and 2018 stock returns for certain ticker symbols. 
2017 stocks listed all saw positive returns, with the outlier being TERP. 
2018 stock returns show negative returns with the exception of ENPH and RUN stocks.

### Refractored code efficiency results

The refactored code runs much faster then the original code.

## Summary
Refactoring the original code provides an advantage in a much cleaner and efficient code as well as a reduced run-time.
